# Tooltip-shortcuts

# 
A script mapped to right-Ctrl + (Numpad0/F20) that allows multiple shortcuts.
I use F20 as secondary trigger because when numlock is off, Numpad0 has the the value F20


The config file:
  * {Action name}|{Action}
  * Examples present in the config file

I also uploaded an executable of the script, but as this is the internet, rather install AutoHotkey and compile it yourself.
Tip: Place it in the Startup folder C:\Users\Anakleta\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup so it runs every time the PC restarts
